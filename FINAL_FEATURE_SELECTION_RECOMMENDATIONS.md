## 🏆 TIER 1: ESSENTIAL FEATURES (Must Include)

### Core Pollutant Features
| Feature | Correlation | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| `pm2_5_nowcast` | 0.9611 | **CRITICAL** | Strongest predictor, fine particulate matter |
| `pm10_nowcast` | 0.9449 | **CRITICAL** | Second strongest, coarse particulate matter |
| `co_ppm_8hr_avg` | 0.8666 | **HIGH** | Traffic pollution indicator |
| `no2_ppb` | 0.8563 | **HIGH** | Traffic/industrial pollution |

### Engineered Core Features
| Feature | Type | Priority | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| `pm2_5_pm10_ratio` | Ratio | **HIGH** | Fine/coarse PM relationship |
| `traffic_index` | Composite | **HIGH** | Combined CO + NO2 traffic indicator |
| `total_pm` | Sum | **MEDIUM** | Combined particulate matter load |

**💡 Recommendation**: Start with these 7 features for baseline models.

## 🥈 TIER 2: VALUABLE FEATURES (Strong Candidates)

### Additional Pollutants
- `co_ppm` (r=0.8649) - Real-time CO measurement
- `so2_ppb` (r=0.8160) - Industrial pollution indicator
- `aqi_owm` (r=0.7675) - External AQI reference

### Temporal Features
- `hour` - Diurnal pollution patterns
- `is_rush_hour` - Traffic-related pollution spikes
- `season` - Seasonal pollution variations
- `is_weekend` - Weekly pollution patterns

**💡 Recommendation**: Add these for enhanced model performance.

---

## 🥉 TIER 3: EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES (Advanced Models)

### Time Series Features
- `pm2_5_nowcast_lag_1h` - Previous hour PM2.5
- `aqi_epa_calc_lag_1h` - Previous hour AQI
- `pm2_5_nowcast_ma_3h` - 3-hour moving average

### Interaction Features
- `pm2_5_x_traffic` - PM2.5 × traffic interaction
- `pm2_5_x_rush` - PM2.5 × rush hour interaction
- `traffic_x_winter` - Traffic × seasonal interaction

**💡 Recommendation**: Use for advanced models and time series forecasting.

---

## ❌ FEATURES TO EXCLUDE

### Low Correlation Features
- `o3_ppb` (r=0.1247) - **EXCLUDE**: Weak predictor
- `o3_ppm` (r=0.1247) - **EXCLUDE**: Redundant with o3_ppb

### Rationale for Exclusion
- Ozone shows minimal correlation with EPA AQI calculation
- Including weak predictors can introduce noise
- Focus computational resources on strong predictors
